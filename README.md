## Workflow tipps

I recomend to use Zotero to collection and organize your research:

https://www.zotero.org

Export your bibliography from Zotero using the Better Bibtex format and replace Bibliothek.bib:

https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex

Now you can drag and drop your cite keys from Zotero right into you latex doc.
